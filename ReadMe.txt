Robot appointment system Read me

Website will be able to run on any operation system, but the sql database and c# behind the scenes code must be run on a windows based server
*Save all website info in one folder, open UTRobotUserInfo.sln
*Open UTRobotUserInfo package (stored on gethub) with micrsoft visual studio (I used 2010 professional)
*Open/create robotvisit sql package with microsoft sql server managment
*Sql server isn't really code, so I can't share the "package" with you, just email me for more info. 
*Pictures on gethub will show you the setup of the table. (if you need to recreate it again)

*You can run the website on the debug/start debuggin tab on visual studio.
*Now viewing the website you can enter information and view your sql table afterwards with the stored information.


Recommended updates(if I'm not allowed in the class next semester somebody else can carry this out)
*Install sql server on UT windows based server and also the website hosted on a ut windows server
*Create check for ut EID
*Create more in depth appointment system
*Create program that allows the robot team to communcate back automatically with the user
*Make a more appealing website
